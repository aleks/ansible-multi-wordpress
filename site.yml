    # Caution: This should only be applied if you want to update multiple wordpress
    # installations and want to do it via the WP Admin instead of SFTP.
    #
    # Afterwards you should remove the "wordpress-update" role and run the playbook again
    # to set the correct file and directory rights.
    #
    # This role sets all directories to www-data:www-data so wordpress can run it's update
    # via the admin backend. This is a security risk and should only be used temporarily!
